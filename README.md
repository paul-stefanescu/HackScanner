# HackScanner
HackScanner:
C# application using the LeapMotion and SkyScanner APIs
The software scrapes the Devpost website for all the available hackathons, parses the resulting .json in order to create an array with all the hackathons and enables the user to browse through the available events via a Leap Motion device. 
Once a hackathon is selected, we use the Skyscanner API to look for the cheapest flights to said location and redirects the user to the flight webpage.
My contribution:
•	Implemented the use of the SkyScanner API.
•	Merged the different parts of the project into the final C# application
